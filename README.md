_REPLACE OR REMOVE EVERYTING BETWEEN "\_"_

### Student Info

-   Name: Jason Chen
-   Section: 05

## Simulation Design

- An aquarium with different species of marine life. Some species may flock together and some species may avoid each other.

### Controls

-   Ideally, I want the player to have no control but for the requirement
-   You can drop fish in of different kinds

## _Agent 1 Name_

The agents are listed in the Simulation Design section.

### _State 1 Name_

**Objective:** _A brief explanation of this state's objective._

#### Steering Behaviors

- Flee - bigger fish
- Obstacles - _List all obstacle types this state avoids_
- Seperation - _List all agents this state seperates from_
   
#### State Transitions

- _List all the ways this agent can transition to this state_
   - _eg, When this agent gets within range of Agent2_
   - _eg, When this agent has reached the target of State2_
   
### _State 2 Name_

**Objective:** _A brief explanation of this state's objective._

#### Steering Behaviors

- _List all behaviors used by this state_
- Obstacles - _List all obstacle types this state avoids_
- Seperation - _List all agents this state seperates from_
   
#### State Transistions

- _List all the ways this agent can transition to this state_

## _Agent 2 Name_

_A brief explanation of this agent._

### _State 1 Name_

**Objective:** _A brief explanation of this state's objective._

#### Steering Behaviors

- _List all behaviors used by this state_
- Obstacles - _List all obstacle types this state avoids_
- Seperation - _List all agents this state seperates from_
   
#### State Transistions

### _State 2 Name_

**Objective:** _A brief explanation of this state's objective._

#### Steering Behaviors

- _List all behaviors used by this state_
- Obstacles - _List all obstacle types this state avoids_
- Seperation - _List all agents this state seperates from_
   
#### State Transistions

- _List all the ways this agent can transition to this state_

## Sources

-   _List all project sources here –models, textures, sound clips, assets, etc._
-   _If an asset is from the Unity store, include a link to the page and the author’s name_

## Make it Your Own

- _List out what you added to your game to make it different for you_
- _If you will add more agents or states make sure to list here and add it to the documention above_
- _If you will add your own assets make sure to list it here and add it to the Sources section

## Known Issues

_List any errors, lack of error checking, or specific information that I need to know to run your program_

### Requirements not completed

_If you did not complete a project requirement, notate that here_
